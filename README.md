# Private Markets Reporting & Governance Portfolio

**Akhil Vohra** | Data & Reporting Analyst

## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates end-to-end reporting and data governance skills applied to a private markets fund administration context — directly mirroring the operational environment at firms like BBH, where fund administrators are responsible for LP reporting, NAV validation, capital activity tracking, and data integrity across multi-currency, multi-fund structures.

The work covers the full reporting lifecycle: raw data ingestion, structured querying, business analysis, governance dashboards, benchmark comparison, and client-facing LP reporting. All four core tools — SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel — are represented with real business use cases.

## Tableau Dashboards (`/tableau`) — Interactive

Built from `private_markets_raw_data_March2026.xlsx` — 8 sheets covering 3 funds, 6 LPs, 107 transactions, 25 quarters of NAV, benchmarks, and performance metrics.

**[Fund Performance & Benchmarking](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/akhil.vohra/viz/FundAdministrationPortfolio-AkhilVohra/PerformanceDashboard)** — Quarterly excess returns vs benchmark (fund return minus benchmark), TVPI heat map by fund and year

**[Capital Activity & LP Overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/akhil.vohra/viz/FundAdministrationPortfolio-AkhilVohra/CapitalDashboard)** — NAV progression vs capital deployed (combo chart), capital calls/distributions/fees by fund, LP commitment breakdown

**Views built:**
- Excess return bar chart (fund quarterly return minus relevant benchmark)
- TVPI heat map (highlight table by fund and year)
- NAV vs capital deployed (dual-axis combo: NAV lines + called capital bars, split by fund)
- Capital calls, distributions and fees by fund (stacked bar over time)
- LP commitment breakdown by fund (horizontal stacked bar by investor)
